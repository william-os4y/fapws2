To have it working you have some pre-requisits:
1) build the sqlite3 database by executing the following command:
"python mysite/manager syncb"
and answer to the different questions (user name, password, email)
2) export the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable:
"export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mysite.settings" 
(for sure, adapt the command export to your shell)
3) add some "initial" data into the DB by running the script set_initial_data.py:
python set_initial_data.py
4) run the server: 
"python run.py"
