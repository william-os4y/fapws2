After having install MoinMoin via your prefered package management tool or via the sources, you need to do ifew steps.

We suppose that insatallation path of MoinMoin is /usr/share/moin. If this is not the case for you, please adapt accordingly the next commands.

This has been tested with MoinMoin-1.5.8

1) create a wiki instance:
- cp -R /usr/share/moin/data .
- cp -R /usr/share/moin/underlay .
- cp /usr/share/moin/config/wikiconfig.py .

For a minimalist installation, I've not made modifications into wikiconfig.py.

2) adap (if required) run.py Staticfile 
3) start fapws2
- python run.py
